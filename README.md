Template for a RubyMotion iOS project, leveraging:

- [ProMotion](https://github.com/clearsightstudio/ProMotion) (framework)
- [Pixate](http://www.pixate.com/) (styling)
- [Motion Layout](https://github.com/qrush/motion-layout) (auto-layout)
- [Motion Cocoapods](https://github.com/HipByte/motion-cocoapods) (CocoaPods, required for Pixate)

As mentioned in Motion Cocoapods, run the command `[bundle exec] pod setup` if this is the first time using CocoaPods. If you want to downloads Pods yourself instead of it being done automatically on a build, run the task `pod:install`.
